# Sierpinski Carpet in OpenGL

Sierpinski Carpet generation using OpenGL and GLUT library. Written in c++.

## Images

### Carpet generated by 6 iterations and width of 728 pixels:

![Carpet by 6 iterations and width of 728 pixels](images/carpet-default.png)

Generated by executing:

```sh
./bin/main --iterations 6 --width 728
```

### Carpet with random color and deformations:

![Carpet with random color and deformations set to 0.3](images/carpet-with-color-and-deformations.png)

Generated by executing:

```sh
./bin/main --iterations 4 --deformation 0.3 --color
```

## Compiling:

To compile the source code execute:

```sh
make
```

or:

```sh
g++ src/main.cpp -lGL -lglut -o bin/main
```

## Usage:

To run the program execute:

```sh
./bin/main
```

### Available parameters:

- `--size <size_in_px>` sets the carpet width and height. The `size_in_px` value must be a power of 3 (default value: 728),
- `--iterations <num_of_iterations>` sets the number of iterations ("the depth of the recursion tree") (default value: 6),
- `--color` sets the color of inner cubes to random values,
- `--deformation <deformation_amount>` randomly deforms the carpet. The `deformation_amount` must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means no deformation. 1.0 means that deformation can achieve a maximum value of one inner square (default value: 0.0)
- `--help` prints help text.
